# Day 6

- to subtract a day from a date we use the function `dateDiff(date1, date2)` not `date-1` because if date was 1-1-2022 and we subtract 1, it won't be 31-12-2021

1. [197. Rising Temperature](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/?envType=study-plan&id=sql-i)
    - easy, just `dateDiff` function


2. [607. Sales Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-person/description/?envType=study-plan&id=sql-i)
    - nice and new idea using `LEFT JOIN` to combine more than 2 tables
    - It can be also solved with the basic select [like that](https://leetcode.com/problems/sales-person/submissions/869699755/)
