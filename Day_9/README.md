# Day 9

- **we can use `if` to control flow (like case when ...) like that**
    ```SQL
    if(operation = 'Buy', -price, price)
    ```
 
    Here, if the operation was 'Buy' then the result would be -price, else it would be price.

- It was the day, combining `if`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- # All ideas in the day were the same, using `control flow` with `JOIN` and `GROUP BY`
